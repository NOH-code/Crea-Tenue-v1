The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack groom outfit visualization application, TailorView, from an initial product idea to a feature-rich, branded, and localized solution. The development followed an iterative approach, starting with core AI image generation and progressively adding complex UI/UX enhancements, branding customizations, a comprehensive back-office, and advanced input methods. Challenges included extensive frontend refactoring for localization, dynamic UI elements, and a recent attempt at implementing a user management system, which led to a temporary breakage in the frontend. The AI engineer demonstrated strong adaptability to detailed user feedback, including complex styling, responsive design, and integration of external assets, while adhering to strict architectural and technical constraints. The application currently functions, but the advanced user management system is partially implemented on the backend and is in the process of being integrated into the frontend.

<product_requirements>
The user requires an application, TailorView, to generate groom outfit illustrations using the Nano Banana image generation API. The core functionality involves uploading a full-length model photo, providing fabric descriptions or photos, and selecting customizable elements: Atmosphere (Rustic/Champêtre, Seaside, Chic & Elegant, Hangover), Suit type (2-piece, 3-piece), Lapel type, Jacket pocket type, Shoe type (with custom description/photo upload), and Accessory (with custom description/photo upload). The generated images must include a brand watermark, be downloadable, and optionally sent via email.

Subsequent requirements included: French localization, prominent brand logo display, removal of default branding, Bodoni Moda font, a back-office view with request statistics, image thumbnails, prompts, and CSV export. The latest, and currently in-progress, requirement is a comprehensive user management system with user registration (Name, Title, Email, Password, Event Date, Communication opt-in), login, and distinct roles: Client (3 photos/day, 10 total), Utilisateur (unlimited), and Administrateur (full access, managing users/limits). It also includes email workflows (welcome, password creation, email verification) and an Utilisateurs tab in the admin panel for user management.

<code_architecture>
The application follows a standard full-stack architecture:



- ****: This is the core backend logic. It defines FastAPI endpoints for image generation, handling file uploads (model photo, fabric, shoes, accessories), sending emails, and managing outfit requests in MongoDB.
    - **Changes**:
        - Initial setup for image generation and email.
        - Integration of Gemini/Nano Banana API.
        - Endpoint for handling outfit generation requests (), which processes various inputs and calls the AI.
        - Endpoint for sending multiple images via email ().
        - Endpoints for admin functionalities: fetching requests (), deleting requests, and managing admin password.
        - New endpoints for user authentication: , , .
        - MongoDB models for  and , storing details like , , .
        - Integration of  for password hashing and JWT for token generation.
        - Initial admin user creation.
        - Logic to enforce  image generation limits.
        - SMTP configuration for email sending, adapted for Workscape/Infomaniak.
- ****: This is the main frontend application file. It contains the primary UI, form for outfit customization, image display, navigation, and integration of various components.
    - **Changes**:
        - Initial UI for form inputs and image display.
        - French localization for all labels, placeholders, and button texts.
        - Integration of the user's watermark logo into the header.
        - Dynamic rendering of photo upload fields for fabric, shoes, and accessories.
        - Conditional rendering for the AdminView and Generator sections.
        - Implementation of dark mode toggle.
        - Integration of a carousel for displaying multiple generated images of the same model.
        - Integration of new AdminView components and email settings.
        - Refactoring attempts for user authentication (Login/Register forms, state management, routing). This part led to a broken state and was partially reverted to a functional version, but user management is not fully integrated yet.
- ****: Contains global CSS styles, including custom fonts and Tailwind overrides.
    - **Changes**:
        - Addition of Bodoni Moda font (with Georgia fallback).
        - Styling for dark mode, ensuring text readability (white text on dark background) and distinct form borders.
        - Styling adjustments for larger logo and removal of rounded borders (e.g., ).
- ****: Global styles for the body and root elements.
    - **Changes**: Updated to support dark mode and ensure consistent font application.
- ****: Environment variables for backend configurations.
    - **Changes**: Added  and  for email functionality, and ,  for the default admin user.
- ****: Directory for Shadcn UI components. These components are used extensively for consistent UI/UX.
    - **Changes**: No direct file creation here, but many existing components (, , , , , , , ) were styled and integrated into  and .
- ****: *New file*. Intended to host login, registration, and user authentication forms.
    - **Changes**: Created but not fully integrated into  in a working state.
- ****: *New file*. Contains the administrative dashboard.
    - **Changes**: Implemented to display request statistics, a table of generated requests with prompts and thumbnails, a section for changing the admin password, and a Télécharger CSV button for data export. Tabs for Dashboard and Emailing were introduced.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on implementing a comprehensive user management system. This involved significant backend changes to  to introduce  models, authentication endpoints (, ), password hashing with , JWT token generation, and initial logic for user roles and image generation limits. A default administrator user ( with password ) was set up.

On the frontend, the AI engineer started creating  for login/registration components and was heavily refactoring  to integrate this new authentication flow. This refactoring proved challenging, leading to multiple JSX syntax errors and a broken frontend UI (Chat Message 265, 267). The last action taken was to diagnose and fix the broken  by restoring it to a functional state, meaning the user management frontend integration is currently incomplete and was effectively reverted to ensure the application loads correctly. While the backend for user management is partially in place, the frontend components and the overall authentication flow are not yet fully operational.

<optional_next_step>
The next step is to continue integrating the user management system on the frontend, focusing on a robust  and  implementation.
