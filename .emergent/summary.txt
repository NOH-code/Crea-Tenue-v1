The AI engineer successfully enhanced the TailorView application through several significant updates. Initially, the focus was on resolving persistent email sending issues, moving from Infomaniak SMTP to Google Workspace SMTP with App Passwords. This required iterative debugging with user input to get the correct authentication. Following this, a comprehensive user authentication system was implemented, including registration, login, JWT-based sessions, role-based access (Client, User, Admin), image generation limits, and an admin panel for user management. The UI was refined with a cleaner, white background, removed branding elements, and integration of the Blandin & Delloye logo. Localization to French was a continuous effort, translating options and adjusting UI text. Finally, conditional description fields for shoes and accessories were added, allowing users to specify custom elements. The dark mode theme was updated to a deeper green, and logo responsiveness was improved. The trajectory concluded with the application in a broken state due due to JSX errors after modifying the admin tabs for user/client requests.

<product_requirements>
The TailorView app generates groom outfit illustrations using the Nano Banana API. Core features include image generation, watermarking, download, and email delivery. Recent requirements involved French localization, a prominent Blandin & Delloye logo (replacing default branding), Bodoni Moda font, and an admin back-office for request statistics, thumbnails, prompts, and CSV export. The most recent phase focused on a user management system with registration, login, roles (Client, Utilisateur, Administrateur), image limits, and admin tools for user management. Specific user requests addressed during this trajectory included fixing SMTP email sending (using Google Workspace and App Passwords), enabling manual email sending post-generation, using a configurable email template without technical details, fixing admin access bugs, implementing user authentication with email/name/password, default image limits (5 per user), a visible image counter, an admin Utilisateurs tab, and minimal security. UI changes included removing the default pictogram/title/subtitle, setting a white background, integrating the Blandin & Delloye logo (light/dark versions), adding Dans la rue à Paris and Dans la rue à New York environments, and conditional text fields for custom shoe/accessory descriptions. Lastly, the dark mode theme needed to be a darker green, and the logo had to remain proportional. The user is also looking for an Administration tab for general users (Client/User) to view their requests and photos, and refined display of email fields in the admin dashboard.

<pending_tasks>
-   **Frontend Bug Fix**: Resolve JSX errors causing the app to be hors service related to admin tab implementation for User/Client requests.
-   **Emailing Tab Functionality**: Implement the module for managing/customizing email templates within  to ensure  and  are user-configurable.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was working on enhancing the Administration section. The user explicitly requested two features:
1.  **Onglet Administration pour User et Client**: A new tab in the Administration section that allows *all* users (User and Client roles, not just Admin) to consult their own generated requests and photos.
2.  **Administration de bord des requêtes je voudrais un champs Utilisateurs, un champs Email du formulaire**: Separate display fields for the Utilisateur (the logged-in user who made the request) and the Email du formulaire (the email provided in the form to receive the image) in the Historique des requêtes table within the Admin Dashboard.

The AI engineer implemented the backend endpoint  and started modifying the frontend () to integrate this user-specific admin tab and adjust the table columns. However, the last action () indicates that the application is currently broken (First fix the app it is broken), suggesting that the frontend changes introduced JSX errors, particularly in the structure of the admin tabs.

<optional_next_step>
Fix the JSX errors in the frontend to restore the application's functionality.
