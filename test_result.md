# THIS SECTION CONTAINS CRITICAL TESTING INSTRUCTIONS FOR BOTH AGENTS
# BOTH MAIN_AGENT AND TESTING_AGENT MUST PRESERVE THIS ENTIRE BLOCK

# Communication Protocol:
# If the `testing_agent` is available, main agent should delegate all testing tasks to it.
#
# You have access to a file called `test_result.md`. This file contains the complete testing state
# and history, and is the primary means of communication between main and the testing agent.
#
# Main and testing agents must follow this exact format to maintain testing data. 
# The testing data must be entered in yaml format Below is the data structure:
# 
## user_problem_statement: {problem_statement}
## backend:
##   - task: "Task name"
##     implemented: true
##     working: true  # or false or "NA"

##     -message: "Communication message between agents"

# Protocol Guidelines for Main agent
#
# 1. Update Test Result File Before Testing:
#    - Main agent must always update the `test_result.md` file before calling the testing agent
#    - Add implementation details to the status_history
#    - Set `needs_retesting` to true for tasks that need testing
#    - Update the `test_plan` section to guide testing priorities
#    - Add a message to `agent_communication` explaining what you've done
#
# 2. Incorporate User Feedback:
#    - When a user provides feedback that something is or isn't working, add this information to the relevant task's status_history
#    - Update the working status based on user feedback
#    - If a user reports an issue with a task that was marked as working, increment the stuck_count
#    - Whenever user reports issue in the app, if we have testing agent and task_result.md file so find the appropriate task for that and append in status_history of that task to contain the user concern and problem as well 
#
# 3. Track Stuck Tasks:
#    - Monitor which tasks have high stuck_count values or where you are fixing same issue again and again, analyze that when you read task_result.md
#    - For persistent issues, use websearch tool to find solutions
#    - Pay special attention to tasks in the stuck_tasks list
#    - When you fix an issue with a stuck task, don't reset the stuck_count until the testing agent confirms it's working
#
# 4. Provide Context to Testing Agent:
#    - When calling the testing agent, provide clear instructions about:
#      - Which tasks need testing (reference the test_plan)
#      - Any authentication details or configuration needed
#      - Specific test scenarios to focus on
#      - Any known issues or edge cases to verify
#
# 5. Call the testing agent with specific instructions referring to test_result.md
#
# IMPORTANT: Main agent must ALWAYS update test_result.md BEFORE calling the testing agent, as it relies on this file to understand what to test next.

COMPREHENSIVE TESTING COMPLETED: ✅ CSV Export endpoint (/api/admin/users/export?format=csv) returns proper CSV files with all required user fields (nom, email, role, images_used_total, images_limit_total, is_active) ✅ JSON Export endpoint (/api/admin/users/export?format=json) returns structured JSON data with complete user information ✅ CSV Import endpoint (/api/admin/users/import) validates data and creates users successfully ✅ JSON Import endpoint handles JSON file uploads correctly ✅ Duplicate email handling works perfectly - prevents duplicate imports with clear error messages ✅ Invalid data validation working - handles missing required fields (nom, email) with detailed error feedback ✅ Admin-only access control enforced - non-admin users correctly blocked (403 Forbidden) for both export and import ✅ Password handling is secure - passwords are properly hashed when importing users ✅ Data integrity maintained throughout export/import process ✅ Error handling provides clear French error messages for import issues ✅ Import supports both CSV and JSON formats with proper file validation. MINOR ISSUE: Invalid format export (XML) returns 500 instead of 400, but this is non-critical. CONCLUSION: Export/Import functionality is production-ready with 8/9 tests passing (89% success rate). Users can safely backup and restore user data with proper validation and security controls."

    message: "CRITICAL FRONTEND ISSUE DISCOVERED: Enhanced email confirmation popup code is present in App.js source but NOT being served to browser. This is a serious frontend build/deployment problem preventing the new email popup feature from working. Multiple cache clears and restarts attempted - code still missing from served JavaScript bundle. Main agent needs to investigate frontend build process or deployment pipeline issue."

All 4 priority email improvements working: 1) Multiple SMTP fallback configurations (Infomaniak 587/465, Gmail) tested and working 2) Email queue system fully functional - failed emails saved to database and /app/email_queue folder 3) Admin email queue endpoint GET /api/admin/email-queue working (fixed ObjectId serialization issue) 4) Users receive clear feedback messages about email status. Failed emails are now queued for manual processing within 24h instead of blocking. Email system no longer blocks user experience."

    message: "GOOGLE WORKSPACE SMTP TESTING COMPLETE: ❌ CRITICAL AUTHENTICATION ISSUE FOUND! Google Workspace SMTP implementation failing with error 535 'Username and Password not accepted' on all SMTP servers (smtp.gmail.com:587, smtp.gmail.com:465). Fixed server configuration from smtp-relay.gmail.com to smtp.gmail.com per Google docs. ROOT CAUSE: App Password 'zexn hsbg nkmh avzr' is invalid OR 2FA not enabled on nepasrepondre@blandindelloye.com. REQUIRES IMMEDIATE ACTION: 1) Verify 2FA enabled on Google Workspace account 2) Generate new App Password 3) Update backend/.env with correct credentials. Send-multiple endpoint also failing due to same SMTP issue. Email queue system working as fallback."

    message: "POST-SECURITY ALERT RE-TESTING COMPLETE: ❌ GOOGLE SECURITY ALERT VALIDATION DID NOT RESOLVE SMTP ISSUE! Despite user validating Google security alert, SMTP authentication still failing with error 535 'Username and Password not accepted' on all servers (smtp.gmail.com:587, smtp.gmail.com:465, mail.infomaniak.com:587). Backend logs show consistent authentication failures. App Password 'zexn hsbg nkmh avzr' is still being rejected by Google's SMTP servers. Email queue system working correctly (17 failed emails queued). CRITICAL FINDING: Security alert validation alone was insufficient to resolve authentication. REQUIRES URGENT ACTION: 1) Verify App Password is correctly generated and active 2) Check if 2FA is properly enabled on nepasrepondre@blandindelloye.com 3) Consider regenerating App Password 4) Verify Google Workspace SMTP settings are correct. Both /api/generate with email and /api/send-multiple endpoints remain non-functional for email delivery."

    message: "🎉 USER MANAGEMENT FUNCTIONALITY COMPLETELY RESOLVED! CRITICAL ISSUE FIXED: The reported problem with updating user image limits in admin panel was caused by duplicate API endpoints. There were two PUT /api/admin/users/ endpoints - one expecting email and one expecting user_id. FastAPI was always routing to the first one (email-based), causing 500 errors when user IDs were passed. SOLUTION: Removed the duplicate email-based endpoint, keeping the comprehensive user_id-based endpoint with fallback support. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: ✅ User Management: 8/8 tests passed ✅ Authentication System: 11/12 tests passed ✅ Admin can successfully update user image limits ✅ Admin can update multiple user fields ✅ Error handling works correctly ✅ Email fallback functionality working ✅ Database operations working perfectly. CONCLUSION: The user management functionality is now fully operational. Admins can successfully modify user image limits through the admin panel without any errors."

    message: "🚨 URGENT IMAGE GENERATION FAILURE DIAGNOSIS COMPLETE! ROOT CAUSE IDENTIFIED AND FIXED: The user's reported 401 Unauthorized errors were caused by a JWT library bug in the backend code. The error 'AttributeError: module jwt has no attribute JWTError' was causing 500 errors instead of proper 401 responses when invalid tokens were used. CRITICAL FINDINGS: ✅ Admin login working perfectly (charles@blandindelloye.com / 114956Xp) ✅ JWT token generation and validation working ✅ Authentication system fully operational ✅ Image generation working perfectly WITH authentication ✅ New atmosphere options (rue_paris, rue_new_york) working correctly ✅ All backend endpoints functional ✅ Email functionality operational ❌ FIXED: JWT error handling bug (changed jwt.JWTError to jwt.InvalidTokenError) DIAGNOSIS: The image generation is NOT crashing - it requires proper authentication. Users must login first to get a valid JWT token, then use that token for image generation. The 401 errors were correct behavior, but the JWT bug was causing confusion. SOLUTION IMPLEMENTED: Fixed JWT error handling in backend/server.py. System now properly returns 401 for invalid tokens instead of 500 errors. IMAGE GENERATION FULLY OPERATIONAL with proper authentication."

    message: "🎉 USER EMAIL TRACKING FIX SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTED AND TESTED! ISSUE ANALYSIS: The original fix code (outfit_record.user_email = current_user.email) was correct but never executed because database save happened AFTER image generation. When Gemini API failed due to quota limits, database save was never reached. SOLUTION: Moved database save BEFORE image generation in /api/generate endpoint. COMPREHENSIVE TESTING RESULTS: ✅ Created test request that successfully populated user_email='charles@blandindelloye.com' ✅ Clear field distinction: user_email (creator) vs email (recipient) ✅ Database structure supports user_email field correctly ✅ Fix works even when image generation fails ✅ Admin dashboard will now show user emails instead of 'N/A' for all new requests. VERIFICATION: Out of 51 total requests, 1 new request has populated user_email (after fix), 50 old requests still have None (before fix). The reported admin dashboard 'N/A' issue is COMPLETELY RESOLVED for all future outfit generations."
